Semester 1 Project – 2025–26

This is the starter Unity project for our class.
It does not include the Library folder or other auto-generated files – Unity will recreate those on your computer.

Getting the Project onto Your Computer:
1. Click the green Code button on this page.
2. Click Open with GitHub Desktop.
3. When GitHub Desktop opens, choose a folder on your computer where you want the project to live
(for example: Documents/UnityProjects/Semester1Project_2025-26).
4. Click Clone.

OR (the method I use bcuz I have a mac):
1. Click the green Code button.
2. Click Download ZIP.
3. When the download is done, unzip the file.
4. Move the unzipped folder to where you keep your Unity projects
(for example: Documents/UnityProjects/Semester1Project_2025-26).

Now the project files are on your computer!!



Any changes you make locally are your own – they don’t automatically change this main class repository. 
Like I said in our Github Desktop Introductory meeting, it's VERY VERY VERYYY IMPORTANT that you make your own repository so you can save your own changes.
If you want to use GitHub for your own version:
1. Create a new repository on your own GitHub account.
2. In GitHub Desktop, change the “Repository → Repository Settings → Remote” to point to your repo, or just create a new repo from the local folder.
3. Do not add or commit the Library folder or other auto-generated Unity folders (they are already ignored by .gitignore).

HAVE FUN DEVELOPING GAME DEVS!!!
